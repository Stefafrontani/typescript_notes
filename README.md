# Typescript

## Intro

It does not make any performance optimizations
It only works on development.
It did not make it to the browser, production environment. Browser does not know what ts is

We write just javascript with a "TypeSystem" layer, which eventually ends up compiling (through ts compiler) to plain javascript.

In other words:

-   Writing typescript is the same as wrting just normal javascript with some "extra documentation"
-   TS has no effect on how our code gets executed in node/browser
-   TS is our pair in extreme programming
